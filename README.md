# Ultramodernism: A Tech Manifesto
Ultramodernism is co-authored my architects, engineers, designers and artists to define the future of autonomous buildings. 
This is our vision.

"We believe in a future where 'living buildings' will transform our life, enable us to regain our time, and connect us more fully with people."

Ultramodernism: 
A movement dedicated to radically advancing the way we live through self-operating buildings. We envision structures that are no longer configured or maintained by people, but have been transformed to be self-operating through technology and exceptional design.

Our Mission
To create a collective of engineers, architects, and designers, who have come together to pioneer this revolutionary approach to our built environment. This manifesto defines the vision and frameworks for a future in which buildings are not managed by us, but operate intelligently on our behalf.


Key Principles

Living buildings- Autonomous structures that sense, respond, and adapt—integrating technology and design to sustain themselves and enrich human life.

Time reclamation – Leveraging technology to restore time to human life.

Human connection – Spaces designed to foster deeper connections between people. 

Radical advancement - Moving beyond incremental progress toward transformative innovation.


This repository contains our full manifesto, technical specifications, design frameworks, and implementation guides for bringing Ultramodernism to life.
