Ultramodernism is co-authored my architects, engineers, designers and artists to define the future of autonomous buildings. 
Ultramodernism: A Tech Manifesto
Our Vision

"We believe in a future where 'living buildings' will transform our life, enable us to regain our time, and connect us more fully with people."

Ultramodernism is a movement dedicated to radically advancing the way we live through self-operating buildings. We envision structures that are no longer configured or maintained by people, but have been transformed to be self-operating through technology and exceptional design.
Our Mission
As a collective of engineers, architects, and designers, we have come together to pioneer a revolutionary approach to our built environment. Our manifesto outlines the principles, technologies, and design philosophies that will lead us toward a future where buildings work for us, not the other way around.
Key Principles

Self-Operating Structures: Buildings that maintain, configure, and optimize themselves
Time Reclamation: Technology that gives people back their time
Human Connection: Spaces designed to foster deeper connections between people
Radical Advancement: Pushing beyond incremental improvements to transformative change
